    "This hands-on workshop demonstrates how to build a conversational agent using Amazon Bedrock with Anthropic Claude, a large language model (LLM), combined with the Langchain library. The agent is designed to provide insights and recommendations about AWS DeepRacer models and training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workshop shows how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create custom Langchain tools to allow the agent to interface with the AWS DeepRacer  service API. This includes listing available models, downloading model artifacts, and extracting model metadata like the training data and reward function.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Initialize a ReAct agent in Langchain and make the custom tools available to it. The agent can reason about which tools to invoke based on the user's questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use prompting techniques like few-shot learning to improve the agent's reasoning capabilities with just a few examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Handle errors gracefully if the agent's responses don't match the expected format.\n",
